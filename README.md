The run_analysis.R script is a script that complete the final assignment for the course "Getting and cleaning data". The requirement to the scripts are the following:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
All code is written using packages from the tidyverse. The two datasets are named after what step they are finished, so the first dataset is called "step_4_data_set.csv" and contains the dataset created while doing up to step 4. The other dataset is called "step_5_data_set.csv", and is the answer to step 5. 

Besides the files run_analysis.R, step_4_data_set.csv and step_5_data_set.csv you will find a codebook, which describes the variables in step_5_data_set.csv, and a broad describtion of the transformation done to create the this and the dataset step_4_data_set.csv.
